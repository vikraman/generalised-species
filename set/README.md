### Constructions of the free commutative monoid

- CMon: universal-algebraic construction
- MSet: swapped-list construction
- NSet: commuted-list construction
- QSet: quotiented-list construction

### Characterisation of free commutative monoids

- MSet.Length: subsingletons
- MSet.Paths: structural properties
- MSet.Cover: path space

- Monoidal: seely isomorphism
- Comm: strong commutative monad structure

### Relational model

- Power: power relative monad
- Day: special case of Day convolution
- hRel: category of relations
- Diff: differential structure
- Esp: coKleisli category (set-truncated generalised species)

### Misc

- Perm/Perm2/Perm3: equivalence with the permutation presentation
- Iso: equivalence of different presentations
- PSh/nPSh: power relative "monad" generalised to higher types
- old: various other attempts and experiments
